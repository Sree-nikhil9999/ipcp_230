# INSTRUCTION POINTER CLASSIFIER BASED PREFETCHING (IPCP)
In this project, we aimed to build upon the original implementation of the research  [paper](https://dpc3.compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/pdfs/Bouquet.pdf)
 by **Samuel Pakalapati** and **Biswabandan Panda** . Our implementation incorporates several modifications and improvements.
  This repository contains a selection of plots, code, tables, and results generated from the traces that can be found here [Graph](https://utexas.app.box.com/s/2k54kp8zvrqdfaa8cdhfquvcxwh7yn85/folder/132804598561),
 [spec](https://dpc3.compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/champsim-traces/speccpu/),[server](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qs8t8-YWc7lLoYbjbH_d3lf1xdoYBznf/view),
 [sat](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xs2t9y4cuqlgrlp/AACpzGOj6BcSB-BUolGaBjbta?dl=0). <br>
 We ran our simulation on the following traces: <br>
- 605.mcf_s-472B.champsimtrace.xz
- 620.omnetpp_s-874B.champsimtrace.xz
- 648.exchange2_s-1227B.champsimtrace.xz
- bc-3.trace.gz
- bfs-3.trace.gz
- cadical-high-60K-1227B.champsimtrace.xz
- cadical-high-60K-134B.champsimtrace.xz
- cc-5.trace.gz
- client_001.champsimtrace.xz
- kissat-inc-high-30K-1802B.champsimtrace.xz
- pr-3.trace.gz
- server_001.champsimtrace.xz
- spec_gcc_001.champsimtrace.xz

 ## results
The results and plots are stored in their respective folders. The 'results' folder contains the simulation results of five given traces,
along with their IPC values, which are saved in the 'results.txt' file.
